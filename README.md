The main objective of this project is to provide exposure to different languages and reduce language barriers between the
inhabitant and migrants with the help of Language Translation. Our special focus is on kids to get exposed to new languages. Our
project also focuses on image processing which helps kids to know about the description, interpretation or understand about
the shown image. These two ideas are united to make a chatbot. A chatbot is an automated program that reenacts human
discussion through voice commands or text conversations or both. It is also known as artificial conversational entity. Chatbots
take care of clients consistently of the day and week and are not restricted by time or a physical area.

This project was done with the assistance of raspberry pi and various Google APK's.
